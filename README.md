# callbackDemo
Demo project showing how to use c type callback to invoke c++ member functions using a lambda function

Comment the #define NO_CLASS line to see the version showing how it is used with a class vs non-class (like traditional c-style callback).

# Tasks
- [X] Create a c function that demostrates using 2 callback functions by reassigning the callback function that is invoked by a static c function.
- [X] Create a c++ class with 2 member functions that can be used as the callback functions invoked by the c callback function.
